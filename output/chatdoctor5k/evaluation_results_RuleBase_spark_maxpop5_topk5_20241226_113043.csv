1. **Fatigue**: The possible diseases related to fatigue include Thoracic aortic aneurysm, Congenital rubella, Normal pressure hydrocephalus, Atrial fibrillation, Lead poisoning, Coronary atherosclerosis, Restless leg syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Fibromyalgia, Cirrhosis, and others.

2. **Shortness of breath**: The possible diseases related to shortness of breath include Atrial fibrillation, Peritonitis, Cirrhosis, Cysticercosis, Atelectasis, Emphysema, Panic disorder, Hyperkalemia, Lung contusion, Asthma, Abscess of the lung, Thoracic aortic aneurysm, Sick sinus syndrome, and others.

3. **Sharp chest pain**: The possible diseases related to sharp chest pain include Coronary atherosclerosis, Sick sinus syndrome, Asthma, Choledocholithiasis, Emphysema, Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), Hyperkalemia, Atelectasis, Panic disorder, Pulmonary eosinophilia, Atrial fibrillation, Acute pancreatitis, Abscess of the lung, Thoracic aortic aneurysm, Fibromyalgia, and others.

4. **Joint pain**: The possible diseases related to joint pain include Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), Nonalcoholic liver disease (NASH), Intracranial hemorrhage, Injury to the hand, and others.

Given the combination of these symptoms, it is essential to consider overlapping conditions that could explain multiple symptoms. Some potential diagnoses might include:

- **Coronary atherosclerosis**: This condition can cause chest pain and shortness of breath due to reduced blood flow to the heart. Fatigue can also be a symptom due to decreased cardiac output.

- **Atrial fibrillation**: This arrhythmia can lead to shortness of breath and fatigue due to ineffective pumping of blood by the heart. It can also cause chest pain if there is an underlying coronary artery disease.

- **Fibromyalgia**: This condition is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. It can also cause sleep disturbances which might contribute to shortness of breath and overall fatigue.

- **Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**: This genetic condition can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue due to the thickening of the heart muscle, which impedes blood flow.

- **Normal pressure hydrocephalus**: This condition can present with fatigue, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairments. While it doesn't directly cause shortness of breath or chest pain, it could be considered in a broader differential diagnosis.

To confirm any of these diagnoses, the patient should undergo a thorough medical evaluation including:

- **Physical examination**: To assess vital signs, heart sounds, lung sounds, joint examination, and general physical health.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To evaluate heart rhythm and detect any signs of ischemia or structural heart disease.

To determine the exact cause of these symptoms, it is important to undergo a series of medical examinations and tests. These may include:

1. **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination should be conducted, focusing on the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and overall health status. This might include listening to the lungs for abnormal sounds, checking the heart rate and rhythm, and examining the throat and nasal passages.

2. **Blood Tests**: Complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection or inflammation, hematologic tests to assess blood health, and possibly other specific tests like Hemoglobin A1c for diabetes screening.

3. **Imaging Studies**: Depending on the initial findings, imaging studies such as X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), plain X-ray, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be recommended to visualize internal structures and identify any abnormalities.

4. **Specialized Procedures**: Depending on the suspicion, procedures like an ophthalmologic examination, diagnostic ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram), or even biopsies might be necessary.

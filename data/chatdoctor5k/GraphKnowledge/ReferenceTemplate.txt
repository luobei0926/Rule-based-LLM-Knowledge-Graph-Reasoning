Based on the symptoms described, the patient may have laryngitis, which is inflammation of the vocal cords. To confirm the diagnosis, the patient should undergo a physical examination of the throat and possibly a laryngoscopy, which is an examination of the vocal cords using a scope. Recommended medications for laryngitis include anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, as well as steroids to reduce inflammation. It is also recommended to rest the voice and avoid smoking and irritants.\n
